                <h1>Vision Capital Growth Fund Terms and Conditions</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the Vision Capital Growth Fund, an investment product offered by Vision Capital, designed to provide monthly dividends to its investors. This fund primarily invests in securities of large-scale, growth-oriented companies, aiming to achieve long-term capital appreciation and consistent dividend income. By investing in the Growth Fund, you agree to the following terms and conditions.</p>


                <h2>Dividend Policy</h2>
                <p>The Growth Fund pays dividends on the 5th of each month. Investors have the option to either withdraw these dividends or reinvest them back into the fund (compound). Please note, dividends that are reinvested will be subject to the same terms as the principal investment, including the lock-in period.</p>

                <h2>Lock-in Period</h2>
                <p>The principal amount invested in the Growth Fund is subject to a 90-day lock-in period from the date of investment. During this period, investors cannot withdraw the principal amount invested. However, dividends generated during this period can be withdrawn unless they are reinvested (compounded), in which case they are also locked for 90 days.</p>

                <h2>Fees</h2>
                <p>The Growth Fund applies the following fee structure:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance Fee:</strong> The performance fee is based on the total amount invested:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>$5,000 - $24,999: 15%</li>
                        <li>$25,000 - $74,999: 10%</li>
                        <li>$75,000 - $249,999: 7.5%</li>
                        <li>$250,000 and above: 5%</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li><strong>Outgoing Wire Transfer Fee:</strong> A fee of $30.00 will be charged for any outgoing wire transfers.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Investment Risks</h2>
                <p>Investing in the Growth Fund involves risks, including the potential loss of principal. The fund invests in growth-oriented companies, which may involve greater volatility and risk than investments in more diversified portfolios. While the fund aims for consistent dividend payments, there is no guarantee of dividend payment amounts, as they depend on the performance of the underlying investments.</p>
                <p>The Growth Fund is not publicly traded, which may limit the liquidity and marketability of your investment. Before investing, consider your financial situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance.</p>

                <h2>General Terms</h2>
                <p>The fund reserves the right to modify terms, conditions, fees, and charges at any time with prior notice to investors. The investment in the Growth Fund does not constitute a deposit or obligation of, or guaranteed by, Vision Capital, nor is it insured by any government agency. Investors are responsible for understanding the tax implications of their investment, including dividend income and capital gains.</p>

                <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By investing in the Growth Fund, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these terms and conditions. You also acknowledge that you are aware of the inherent risks involved in this investment and have made your investment decision based on your judgment and advice from financial advisors, as necessary.</p>
